üßê Want to contribute ?

The docs are separated into sections and subsections

If you want to create a new section add a new folder under `izmjs.github.io/src/docs` and make sure the name of your folder is snake-cased afterwards you can go to that section and create a new `mdx` file (also snake-cased) with title of the feature you want to cover.

If your feature you're covering is a bit long, make sure to divide it up with subtitles for example: `## feature` so that the Table of contents can pick it up and display it

When you're done go to the `/config` folder you'll find `sidebar.yml` where you can link your newly added features and so they can show up on the site's navigation.

```yaml
- label: "Section"
  link: "/section"
  items:
    - label: "Sub Section"
      link: "section/sub-section"
    - label: "Sub Section"
      link: "section/sub-section"
    - label: "Sub Section"
      link: "section/sub-section"
```
